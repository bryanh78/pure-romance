    	<p>asdfaesfaewfaefafaWe can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Can I use the gun? I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.

No argument here. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? And then the battle's not so bad? What are their names? Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be fearedâ€¦ Kif might! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Bender, you risked your life to save me! Ow, my spirit! Yeah, lots of people did. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Now what? For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Say what? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.

Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</p>
